1- A web browser uses language softwares to write instructions on how to interpret the information gathered from the internet, rendering an intended sequence of text, images, ect.

2-The DOM is an interface that controls how a digital document is integrated by assigning nodes to a specific programming language.

3- HTML is the standard tagging element and web language, typically first used to render content wihout repetition. XML is an extension that describes document nodes and can update pages without refreshing them.  XHTML is a hybrid of the other two that is more precise in detail and location, ideally used for mobile devices. 

4- There are four elements that are considered paramount for every HTML page. The DOCUMENT TYPE indicating the page version. The ROOT ELEMENT that defines the code and is placed around all other content. The HEAD ELEMENT which may include information for indexing the site for external sources. And the BODY ELEMENT that contains all the data intended for the browser's display. 

5- The INDEX is like the homepage of the site, usually named 'index.html'. It should typically be placed in the first initial spot in a website's directory tree.

6- Typically, the best naming practices for organizing clear code involve categorizing content of the website in distinct folders, keeping specific website content in a 'root' folder, which also includes the index, keep things in names lowercase unless multiple words are used in a file's name, not starting off wiht file names with numbers, avoid symbol characters (like the ones used in "son of a *%$&#!").
