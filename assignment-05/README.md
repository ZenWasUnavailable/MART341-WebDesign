I took a national park class in fall second year. It felt special because I was exploring an entirely new subject I've never considered before and just chose on a whim. It was astonishing to hear about all the locations listed, how part recreation is monitored, and what having a national park gives to us. The class was also executed perfectly, which I think helped a lot for my experience with it. The same way how a well designed website could make any topic no matter how dull it appears seem fascinating.
