        *The Inspiration Catalogue

    <h3>
        </p>(these are NOT official names and I do NOT plan on using them)</p>
    
        </p>I value inspiration as one of the core attributes to achieving self actualization, and believe it to be something everyone should feel. This website could help some inspire others and bounce off each other with posts, prompts, blogs, or drafts of any kind.</p>

        The Real World 
    </h1>

    <h3>
        <p>I can't be the only one tired of all the bias and manipulation of spreading information innefficiently across the web. I want to create something that focuses on cold, calculated logic and research where everything posted on this website will not have value unless presented clearly and self-controlled with facts and references to back it up.</p>

        Axl Mixr

    <h3>
        </p>(We needed three examples sooooo..)</p>
    
        </p>A beginner friendly platform for creating and editing video media with raw tools and no overbloated software. A beginner friendly interface that has a plethora of unique interactive features that feels like using those futuristic models from sci-fi films.</p>
